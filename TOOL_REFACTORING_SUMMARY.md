# Tool Refactoring Summary

## Problem

Tests were failing with `NameError: uninitialized constant Tools::BusinessHours` because all tools were defined inline in a single file (`general_info.rb`), preventing proper Rails autoloading.

## Solution

Split the monolithic `general_info.rb` file into separate, autoloadable files following Rails conventions.

## Changes Made

### New File Structure

```
app/services/tools/
â”œâ”€â”€ general_info.rb       # Registry (12 lines)
â”œâ”€â”€ business_hours.rb     # BusinessHours tool (105 lines)
â”œâ”€â”€ locations.rb          # Locations tool (152 lines)
â””â”€â”€ general_faq.rb        # GeneralFaq tool (135 lines)
```

### Before (401 lines in one file)
```ruby
module Tools
  class GeneralInfo
    def self.all
      [BusinessHours, Locations, GeneralFaq]
    end
  end

  class BusinessHours < RubyLLM::Tool
    # 100+ lines of code
  end

  class Locations < RubyLLM::Tool
    # 150+ lines of code
  end

  class GeneralFaq < RubyLLM::Tool
    # 130+ lines of code
  end
end
```

### After (4 separate files)

**general_info.rb** (Registry):
```ruby
module Tools
  class GeneralInfo
    def self.all
      [BusinessHours, Locations, GeneralFaq]
    end
  end
end
```

**business_hours.rb**, **locations.rb**, **general_faq.rb**: Individual tool implementations

## Benefits

### 1. **Rails Autoloading Works** âœ…
- Each class in its own file following Rails conventions
- `Tools::BusinessHours` â†’ `app/services/tools/business_hours.rb`
- Tests can now properly require and load tools

### 2. **Better Maintainability** âœ…
- Each tool is independently maintainable
- Easier to understand individual tool implementations
- Clear file organization

### 3. **Improved Testability** âœ…
- Can test tools in isolation
- Faster test suite (only load what you need)
- Clearer test structure

### 4. **Easier Reusability** âœ…
- Tools can be used independently
- Other agents can selectively load specific tools
- Better separation of concerns

### 5. **Follows Rails Conventions** âœ…
- One class per file
- File name matches class name (snake_case â†’ CamelCase)
- Proper autoloading support

## Test Results

**Before**:
```
NameError: uninitialized constant Tools::BusinessHours
```

**After**:
```
48 examples, 0 failures

Tools::BusinessHours     (12 tests) âœ…
Tools::Locations         (15 tests) âœ…
Tools::GeneralFaq        (12 tests) âœ…
Agents::InfoAgent        (9 tests)  âœ…
```

## Migration Guide

No changes needed for existing code! The `Tools::GeneralInfo.all` interface remains the same:

```ruby
# This still works exactly as before
@tools = Tools::GeneralInfo.all
@tools.each { |tool| @chat.with_tool(tool) }

# Individual tools can also be used directly now
hours_tool = Tools::BusinessHours.new
result = hours_tool.execute(day: "today")
```

## Files Modified

1. âœ… **app/services/tools/general_info.rb** - Simplified to registry only
2. âœ… **app/services/tools/business_hours.rb** - New file (extracted)
3. âœ… **app/services/tools/locations.rb** - New file (extracted)
4. âœ… **app/services/tools/general_faq.rb** - New file (extracted)
5. âœ… **spec/services/agents/info_agent_spec.rb** - Minor test fix ('day' parameter)

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Short Term
- Consider adding a base class for common tool functionality
- Add tool-specific test files (currently all in one spec file)

### Medium Term
- Implement tool versioning
- Add tool metadata (author, version, description)
- Create tool documentation generator

### Long Term
- Dynamic tool loading from configuration
- Plugin architecture for third-party tools
- Tool marketplace/registry

## Conclusion

This refactoring fixes the critical test failure while improving code organization and maintainability. All 48 tests now pass, and the codebase follows Rails conventions for autoloading.

**Impact**:
- ðŸ”´ Critical issue resolved
- âœ… All tests passing
- ðŸŽ¯ Better code organization
- âš¡ Improved maintainability
- ðŸ“š Ready for future enhancements

**Timeline**: ~30 minutes
**Complexity**: Low
**Risk**: None (backward compatible)
